                <h3>Family</h3>
                <p>My son, when he was 4 years old, began to show great interest in the English word ‘family’ after he had watched the public-interest advertisement of ‘family’ on CCTV. Recently, he has asked me to teach him how to write on his word-pad,
                    and the first English word he wants to learn is ‘family’ because he likes it very much...</p>

                <p>China, slow down your foot please Miracles were created one by one in china in last 30 years. Politicians are pleased,experts are amused, businessmen are excited , the world is shocked. But, do china need miracles? China is a young man,
                    his hands are tender, his shoulders are fragile, his experiece is shortened, his ability is limited. Miracles were created, and his boby, his power and his future were overdrafted. He is tired. He needs a rest and reconsideration.

                    hero chose to spend his last days or his last hours. I speak, of course, of free men who have a choice, not condemned criminals whose sphere of activities is strictly delimited. Such stories set us thinking, wondering what we should
